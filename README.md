# dtp-exploit-poc

Simple and single purpose [PoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) app built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to demonstrate [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) leak vulnerability in **Delhi Traffic Police**'s [notice payment](https://delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/notice/pay-notice/) website.

To test on your phone, download [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) / [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)) and scan the QR code on [https://expo.io/@vaibhavpandeyvpz/dtp-exploit-poc](https://expo.io/@vaibhavpandeyvpz/dtp-exploit-poc) using your phone camera to run it.

Potential derivatives can also be used to create lookup tables by generating random vehicle numbers in acceptable ranges for each RTO. I have been trying to report this several times since almost a year on various email address(es) but no one has fixed this yet.

Please fix this immediately by simply masking the mobile number on server-side instead of doing it on client-side. This is being exploited in wild since ever to harass people.

**EDIT:** (20121/06/02) This is thankfully patched now.
